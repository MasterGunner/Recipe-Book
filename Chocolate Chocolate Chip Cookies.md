# Chocolate Chocolate Chip Cookies

## Ingredients
+ 1 ½ cups white sugar
+ 1 cup butter, softened
+ 2 eggs
+ 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
+ 2 cups all-purpose flour
+ ⅔ cup cocoa powder
+ ¾ teaspoon baking soda
+ ¼ teaspoon salt
+ 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
+ ½ cup chopped walnuts (Optional) 

## Instructions
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Beat sugar, butter, eggs, and vanilla in a large bowl until light and fluffy.

Combine flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt in another bowl; stir into the butter mixture until well blended. Mix in chocolate chips and walnuts. Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets.
