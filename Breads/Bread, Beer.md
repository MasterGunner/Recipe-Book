# Beer Bread

## Ingredients
+ 3 cups flour (sifted)
+ 3 teaspoons baking powder (omit if using Self-Rising Flour)
+ 1 teaspoon salt (omit if using Self-Rising Flour)
+ 1⁄4 cup sugar
+ 1 (12 ounce) can beer
+ 1⁄2 cup melted butter (1/4 cup will do just fine)

## Instructions
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Mix dry ingredients and beer.

Pour into a greased loaf pan.

Pour melted butter over mixture.

Bake 1 hour, remove from pan and cool for at least 15 minutes.

## Notes
If you prefer a softer crust (like a traditional bread) mix the butter into the batter instead of pouring it over the top.
