# Pizza Dough

## Ingredients
+ 350g Flour
+ 8g Table Salt
+ 8g Yeast
+ 1 Cup Water
+ 2 Tablespoons Olive Oil

## Instructions
### For the dough
Mix the flour, salt, and yeast in a big bowl with your hands or a wooden spoon.

Add the water and the olive oil and keep on mixing until the dough comes together into a ball.

Dump the dough out onto a lightly floured countertop, then knead it with your hands until it is smooth and elastic. The dough should feel pretty wet!

Divide the dough into two halves. With lightly floured hands, gather each half into a ball, holding it up off the counter.

Pour a few tablespooons of olive oil into the bottoms of two 10-inch round cake pans or cast iron pans and rub it all around with your hands to coat the bottom and sides. Don't wash your hands yet!

Plop a dough ball into the center of each pan and turn it over a few times to coat it in olive oil. Cover the pan with plastic and set it aside in a warm place for about two hours. Go read a book or play a really long around of hide-and-seek.

### To Top and Bake
Set the oven rack on the lowest shelf and then preheat the oven as hot as it will go (500F-550F). Remove the plastic wrap, then push, pull, and stretch the dough out into the corners of the pans, completely filling them and making sure no big air bubbles are trapped underneath. It's OK if you accidentally poke a few holes. Pizza is always delicious.

Cover each pizza with sauce, grated mozzarella, and whatever toppings you'd like. Bake until the tops of the pizza are bubbly and the bottoms, when you carefully lift the edges with a thin spatula, are golden brown and crips.

Transfer the pizzas to a cutting board, cut into slices, and eat!
