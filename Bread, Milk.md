# Milk Bread

## Ingredients
+ 100% Flour
+ 65% Liquid (half milk, half water)
+ 11% Fat (Butter or Oil)
+ 9.7% Sugar
+ 2% Salt
+ 1% Yeast

## Instructions
Big mixing bowl. Tepid Liquid goes first. Then, Yeast, sugar, salt, fat, flour. Mix it till shaggy mess.

Cover and wait for 1 hour. This is the "Autolyse".

Knead the dough for 5 minutes straight. Pause for 15 minutes. Knead again for 5 minutes.
Dough should be smooth by now.

Add oil in a big bowl, place the dough in. Wipe the bowl with it. Cover with cling film.

1st proofing starts. Wait till it has doubled in size, usually 2 hours. Sometimes more. You could also wait a day or two if it proofs in the fridge.

Deflate. Divide in half. If you just want to bake one loaf in the end, that's the moment to freeze the one of the doughs. Flatten to the width of your (oiled) cake pan. As my dough is soft, i use my hands. Roll up. Place in, with the seam facing down. 

Let it proof again, until doubled in size again, then bake it. ( no punching this time )

200°C - 400°F for 30 minutes or golden brown on top. Brush the top with butter. Let it cool down 30 minutes. Enjoy.

## Notes
Really more of a Pain de Mie.

Start with 400g flour for an 8x4 bread pan, or 500g for a 9x4x4 pullman pan.

For Pullman, experiment with 350°F for 45 minutes.
