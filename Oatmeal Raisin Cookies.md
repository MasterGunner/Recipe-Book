# Oatmeal Raisin Cookies

## Ingredients
+ 1/2 cup Butter
+ 1/2 cup Sugar
+ 1/2 cup Brown Sugar
+ 1 teaspoon Vanilla
+ 1 Egg
+ 3/4 cup All-Purpose Flour
+ 1 teaspoon Cinnamon
+ 1/4 teaspoon Cloves
+ 1/4 teaspoon Nutmeg
+ 1/2 teaspoon Salt
+ 1/2 teaspoon Baking Soda
+ 1 1/2 cups Rolled Oats
+ 1 cup Raisins

## Instructions
Preheat oven to 375Â°F. Sift together the dry ingredients (excluding the rolled oats and raisins), and set aside.

In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg, then add the vanilla. Gradually stir in the dry ingredients, and then fold in the rolled oats and raisins. Shape and place the cookies 2 inches apart onto an ungreased cookie sheet, and flatten slightly.

Bake for 9 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. Store in an airtight container.
