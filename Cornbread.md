# Sweet Skillet Cornbread

## Ingredients
+ 1 egg
+ 1/3 cup vegetable oil
+ 1 cup milk
+ 3/4 cup sugar
+ 3/4 teaspoon salt
+ 1 heaped tablespoon baking powder
+ 1 cup flour
+ 1 cup cornmeal
+ For the pan: 1 tablespoon unsalted butter

## Instructions
Place a heavy 10-inh nonstick skillet (or a well-seasoned cast iron skillet) in the oven and pre-heat to 400F.

Whisk together all the wet batter ingredients with the sugar until smooth. Whisk in the flour and corn meal until just smooth. Don't over-mix.

When the oven and pan are hot, take out the pan and put in the butter. Swirl it until it's melted. Use a paper towel to smear butter around the edges and also to absorb any excess. Pour in the batter and return the pan to the oven.

Bake 20-25 minutes, until a skewer comes out clean. Be careful not to over-bake. Let rest 5 minutes before turning out to cool on a wire rack.
