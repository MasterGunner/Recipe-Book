# Date Nut Loaf

## Ingredients
+ 1 cup (235ml) boiling water
+ 1 cup (150g) chopped dates
+ ½ cup (115g) butter, softened
+ 1 cup (200g) granulated sugar
+ 2 large eggs
+ 2 cups (280g) all-purpose flour
+ 1 tsp baking soda
+ ½ tsp ground cinnamon
+ Optional: a dash of other spices, up to and including pumpkin spice mix
+ 1 cup (115g) chopped walnuts or pecans

## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan.
2. Pour boiling water over the chopped dates and let stand for at least 5 minutes. Do not drain.
3. In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs.
4. In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, and cinnamon. Add to the creamed mixture alternately with the dates and their water. Mix until barely combined.
5. Fold in the chopped nuts.
6. Turn into the prepared pan and bake for roughly 55-65 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean.
7. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.

## Notes
For a more christmas cake-like version, substitute the sugar with dark brown sugar, and use ¾ cups (180ml) boiling water with ¼ cup (60ml) molasses to add to the dates in step 2.
