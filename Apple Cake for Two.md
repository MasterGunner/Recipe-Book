# Apple Cake for Two

## Ingredients
60 mL (¼ cup) butter, melted
125 mL (½ cup) sugar mix white & brown  
1 large egg  
2 mL (½ tsp) cinnamon  
1 mL (¼ tsp) cloves  
1 mL (¼ tsp) allspice  
2 mL (½ tsp) pure vanilla extract  
125 mL (½ cup) packed grated apple (from 1 - small apple)  
125 mL (½ cup) all-purpose flour  
2 mL (½ tsp) baking powder  
2 mL (½ tsp) salt
60 mL (¼ cup) chopped pecans or other nuts, optional

## Instructions
Preheat the oven to 350°F (180ºC).  

Grease a 6" square or round cake pan with butter.  

Beat together the butter and sugar.  

Add the egg, cinnamon, cloves, allspice and vanilla and beat another minute.  

Grate in the apple and beat until well combined.  

Combine the flour, salt and baking powder then stir into the apple mixture until just combined.  

Do not overmix.  

Stir in the pecans at this point.  

Pour the batter into the pan, and bake for about 40 minutes.  

Moist crumbs on a toothpick inserted in the middle indicate done.  

Allow the cake to cool completely on a wire rack.  


## Notes
Serve with some butterscotch sauce.

Adding a ¼ tsp of cardamom doesn't go arwy.
