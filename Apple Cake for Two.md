# Apple Cake for Two

## Ingredients
- ¼ cup butter, melted
- ½ cup sugar mix white & brown  
- 1 large egg  
- ½ tsp cinnamon  
- ¼ tsp cloves  
- ¼ tsp allspice  
- ½ tsp pure vanilla extract  
- ½ cup packed grated apple (from 1 - small apple)  
- ½ cup all-purpose flour  
- ½ tsp baking powder  
- ½ tsp salt
- ¼ cup chopped pecans or other nuts, optional

## Instructions
Preheat the oven to 350°F (180ºC).  

Grease a 6" square or round cake pan with butter.  

Beat together the butter and sugar.  

Add the egg, cinnamon, cloves, allspice and vanilla and beat another minute.  

Grate in the apple and beat until well combined.  

Combine the flour, salt and baking powder then stir into the apple mixture until just combined.  

Do not overmix.  

Stir in the pecans at this point.  

Pour the batter into the pan, and bake for about 40 minutes.  

Moist crumbs on a toothpick inserted in the middle indicate done.  

Allow the cake to cool completely on a wire rack.  


## Notes
Serve with some butterscotch sauce.

Adding a ¼ tsp of cardamom doesn't go arwy.
