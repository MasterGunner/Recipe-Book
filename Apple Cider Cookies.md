# Apple Cider Cookies

## Ingredients
- 3/4 cup unsalted butter softened
- 1 cup light brown sugar packed
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1 large egg
- 2 cups flour
- 1/2 tsp. salt
- 1 tsp. baking soda
- 2 tsp. cinnamon
- 1/2 tsp. nutmeg
- 1/4 tsp Ground Ginger
- 1/4 tsp Ground Cardamom
- 1 cup chopped apple
- 1/4 cup apple cider
- optional pecans raisins, well just about anything your heart desires

For the icing:
- 3 Tbls. melted butter
- 1/3 cup of apple cider
- 3 cup powdered sugar

## Instructions
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees - cream the butter and sugar in a large bowl, add the egg, combine the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, nutmeg in a bowl and gradually add to the butter-sugar-egg mixture until combined then add in chopped apples & apple cider stir to combine.
  
  Drop by LARGE spoonfuls onto cookie sheet - I use a scoop just about the size of an ice cream scooper- DON'T FEAR THE GIANT COOKIE!
  
  Bake for 18 minutes.
  
  After the cookies cool drizzle - yep DRIZZLE on the cookies - my theory has always been the more icing the better but I learned with these the drizzle is the key!
